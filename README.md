# Kraken-Firmware

Welcome!

This is the Repository for the firmware for the Kraken submarine
Our electrical system is controlled by STM32 chips and so the vast majority of the firmware will be for STM32.
The STM32 firmware is written in C or C++ and we typically flash it using the STM32 Cube IDE.
If you have any questions please reach out on the Auvic discord.
